High level appraoch :

  The program will recieve the IP packets containing TCP. From those packets filtering of the intended packet
will be done based on the ip address and port address. Each a time the program is launched a free port will be
picked. After filtering the recieved packets, check sum validation will be done. If the checksum validation
is passed then the sequence number valdiation will be done, if the sequence number validation is also passed
then ack will be sent and data will be written to the file.


features implemented in IP :
1. IP header formation
2. extracting IP header fields form the received ip packet
3. combining the TCP packet and the IP header to form a complete IP packet
4. checksum verification


features implemented in TCP :
1. TCP header formation and extraction
2. TCP check sum calculation
3. handling out-of-order packets and duplicate packets
4. Time out functionality
5. Three way hand shake
6. connection tear down


Challenges :

Debugging the issues was very hard as we had to analyze the wire shark capture file and find out the possible cause.
For instance, we faced an issue at random times one packet of data won't be written to the output file, after hours
of trouble shooting we figured that some times server sends last packet of data in the FIN packet but we assumed that
FIN packet won't be having any data. Then we changed our accordingly to fix this issue.
